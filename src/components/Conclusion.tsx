          This internship at <span className="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300 font-medium">Tunisie Telecom</span> provided a valuable opportunity to work in a governmental telecommunications environment, exposing me to unique operational dynamics distinct from those typically found in the private sector. The experience emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance, resource management within public frameworks, and a structured approach to problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
          A significant highlight of this internship was developing practical <span className="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300 font-medium">automation scripts</span> in both Python and PowerShell. These scripts demonstrated my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into tangible solutions for system administration challenges. By creating tools for system monitoring, user management, and network testing, I gained deeper insights into the critical role of automation in modern IT infrastructure.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
          The experience offered a deeper understanding of how governmental priorities influence technical decision-making and organizational practices. It allowed me to apply academic knowledge to practical scenarios and develop technical and soft skills essential for my future career as an IT manager. The mentorship of <span className="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300 font-medium">Mr. Hbib Jbir</span> and hands-on practice significantly enriched my learning experience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
          As I conclude this internship, I feel more prepared and excited about pursuing a career in IT management. The skills, knowledge, and experiences gained during these five weeks have laid a strong foundation for my professional growth and future contributions to the field of information technology.
